# Scalper Vault

This is a code implementation of a professional scalping system for successful trading in the forex market. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for both forex and binary options traders. The recommended time frame for this system is M5. The system generates accurate arrow signals indicating the trend direction and top/bottom signals for potential reversals. Gann market levels are also incorporated to provide valuable market insights.

## Installation and Usage

To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader 5 platform installed. Once you have the platform, follow the steps below:

1. Open the MetaEditor in MetaTrader 5.
2. Create a new Expert Advisor (EA) script.
3. Copy and paste the code provided into the EA script.
4. Save the script and compile it.
5. Drag and drop the compiled EA onto a chart in MetaTrader 5.
6. Adjust the desired settings for the EA and start trading.

## Dependencies

This code relies on the following libraries and indicators:

- `Trade.mqh`: This library provides trading functions and methods.
- `Gann.mqh`: This indicator calculates Gann levels.

Please ensure that these dependencies are included in your MetaTrader 5 installation.

## Indicator Initialization

The custom indicator initialization function (`OnInit`) is responsible for setting up the indicator parameters, buffers, and properties. In this code, we set up 4 indicator buffers for storing the arrow and signal values. We also define the styles and arrow symbols for each buffer. Additionally, the Gann levels are initialized using the `gann.Init()` method.

## Indicator Calculation

The custom indicator iteration function (`OnCalculate`) is called for each new tick in the market. In this function, the Gann levels are calculated using the `gann.Calculate()` method. Then, arrow signals are generated based on the values stored in the indicator buffers. If the value in `g_ibuf_88` is 1, a buy signal is triggered using the `trade.Buy()` method. If the value in `g_ibuf_89` is 1, a sell signal is triggered using the `trade.Sell()` method. Similarly, top/bottom signals are generated based on the values in `g_ibuf_90` and `g_ibuf_91`, and corresponding positions are closed using the `trade.CloseBuy()` and `trade.CloseSell()` methods.
